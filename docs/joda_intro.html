<h1>ioda fulltext engine</h1>
<h2>Introduction to the Interface Documentation of the ioda Binaries</h2>
</div>

<p>From the ioda project four binaries - working with the same data format -
are available:</p>
<ol>

<li>"joda" is a command line program which offers the complete functionality
of ioda.	This interfase is completely described <a href="joda_interface.html">here</a>.</li>

<li>"jodad" is the server version of joda and offers the main functions.
Please see <a href="jodad_interface.html">jodad_interface</a>.</li>

<li>"libjodafulltext.so" is a library which can be used native from a 
C-program or - with the aid of import modules - by other languages. 
Ready-to-go import moduls for Perl and Python can be found in the 
ioda project files. The library offers the same main functions as the jodad 
server. (please see jodafulltext.h in the source package for the interface.).</li>

<li>jodacgi is a CGI program for simple access to the fulltext index
through a web interface. It offers only retrieving functions.
The published programm is only a trunk to demonstrate how it works 
basically. No HTML-formatting is done and the format of the meta data 
is only a suggestion. Some documentation can be found in the source file jodacgi.pas.</li>
</ol>

<p class="i">For all cases: Please read THIS document first for understanding the basics.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Remarks:</h3>

<p>joda can index files from the file system and/or files coming from
a master database, i.e. a SQL database.</p>

<p>In the database config file (*.config) the parameter "useFileRef" decides
which mode will be used. If set to a value of 1 (on) or 2 (on plus memory 
cache) joda will create a list (*.ref file) containing all names of the 
files which has been indexed. In this case joda itself assigns an ID value 
to every file. This id is stored with every (first occurence of a) word 
of the file and is used for all retrieving and deleting purposes.</p>

<p>In the other case -  without file reference - no *.ref file will created, 
joda must get the ID for each record to be stored from the calling programm. 
In all common cases the ID is the primary or unique key of the database 
record to be archived.</p>

<h3>Extended Features (datestamp and bitfilters):</h3>
<p>In general joda stores the source ID of each words, the word position (in a 
word count value) and an additional, optional info byte. This needs 8 bytes 
for the first occurence of a word in a file and 4 bytes for repeaters. With 
the parameter "useBigOccList" it is possible to store more meta data with 
every word. This needs more disk space and therefore reduces the performance 
a little. But in the case if joda runs as a stand alone database (without a SQL 
master database) it could makes sense.</p>

<p>If using "bigOccList=10", joda stores a datestamp with every word. This 
stamp is 16 bit value, internally counting days from Jan. 1st 1995.
It enables joda for a datestamp filter while retrieving. So a datestamp 
range can given (from date ... to date).</p>

<p>If using "bigOccList=12", joda stores a datestamp like descibed above and
additional 16 bits of information with each(!) word. So the formerly info 
byte now gets into a triple byte value (24 bit). There are quite sophisticated 
methods to use this bits as filters for retrieving. For this extended feature, 
an extra documentation needs to be written ... </p>

<p>Please remember that neither the datestamp nor the infobytes are needed in 
most cases and surely not, if joda is running rather as a slave to a SQL 
database that stand alone.</p>
